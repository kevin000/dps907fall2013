    <p>Create an in-memory data store, a simple generic list of colours</p>
    <p>This app features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>an in-memory data store</li>
        <li>the store is a 'per-request' store - it gets created when the controller is instantiated, and it is discarded after the
            request has been serviced</li>
        <li>the store is a simple generic list of strings (of colours)</li>
        <li>as a bonus feature, ajax.html will call the web service, and use the results to modify the web page</li>
    </ul>
