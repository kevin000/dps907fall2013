    <h3>First persistent store example, sep10v2</h3>
    <p>This is our first code example that uses a persistent store</p>
    <p>This app features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Web.config connection string to a database server</li>
        <li>A data model with two associated class definitions</li>
        <li>A store initializer to create initial data (it gets executed via Global.asax.cs)</li>
        <li>View model classes to custom-shape the results</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By the end of the class, we had defined some view model classes for one entity; we'll continue in the next class session
    </p>
    <p><strong>Notice</strong></p>
    <p>We learned (in class) about a configuration issue with the College lab computers</p>
    <p>
        Do not store your project in the default offered location in the File > New > Project dialog (because we don't have full
        file system permissions there)
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead, store it somewhere else - on your own media, or the Documents folder (or desktop) of the current logged-in user
    </p>
